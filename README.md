# logix-type - provider of the LogixType trait and derive macro

Welcome to `logix-type`, the dedicated parser for `.logix` files, used by the `logix` crate. It aims to be a user readable format that is easy to both read and write. This makes `logix-type` an essential part of the Logix ecosystem.

## Goals

- A syntax that is easy to read and write for humans
- Include basic programming primitives without letting it go too far

## Current Focus

The focus of this crate is to provide the config format needed by [Logix](https://github.com/logix-tool/logix). Compatibility will be broken without considerations at this stage.
